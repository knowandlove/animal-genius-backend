# ðŸ«§ Bubble Pop Symphony - Game Design Document

## Overview
**Game Title**: Bubble Pop Symphony  
**Platform**: Web (React + Rive)  
**Target Audience**: K-12 Students  
**Game Duration**: 60-90 seconds per session  
**Core Loop**: Move fish â†’ Pop bubbles â†’ Create music â†’ Earn happiness points  

## Game Concept
A musical arcade game where players control their pet fish to pop bubbles, creating melodies while earning points. Each bubble produces a musical note, encouraging players to create harmonious combinations while improving their pet's happiness.

## Core Mechanics

### 1. Movement System
- **Control Method**: 
  - Desktop: Arrow keys or WASD
  - Mobile: Touch and drag or virtual joystick
- **Movement Style**: Smooth, physics-based swimming
- **Speed**: Base speed with slight acceleration
- **Boundaries**: Soft boundaries that gently push fish back

### 2. Bubble System
- **Spawn Pattern**: Bubbles rise from bottom at varying speeds
- **Bubble Types**:
  - ðŸ”µ **Blue Bubbles** - C note (1 point)
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green Bubbles** - E note (2 points)
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Bubbles** - G note (3 points)
  - ðŸ”´ **Red Bubbles** - B note (4 points)
  - ðŸŒˆ **Rainbow Bubbles** - Chord (10 points + bonus mode)
  - âš« **Black Bubbles** - Dissonant note (-2 points, avoid!)

### 3. Scoring System
- **Base Points**: As listed above per bubble type
- **Combo Multiplier**: 
  - 3 bubbles in 2 seconds = 2x multiplier
  - 5 bubbles in 3 seconds = 3x multiplier
  - 10 bubbles in 5 seconds = 5x multiplier
- **Musical Bonus**: Pop bubbles in harmonic sequence for +20% score
- **Perfect Pop**: Hit bubble at maximum size for +50% points

### 4. Musical System
- **Note Mapping**: Each bubble color plays a pentatonic scale note
- **Harmony Detection**: System recognizes chord progressions
- **Background Track**: Ambient ocean sounds with adaptive tempo
- **Sound Effects**: 
  - Bubble pop (pitched to note)
  - Combo achievement chime
  - Miss/hit wrong bubble sound

## Game Flow

### Start Screen
1. Fish swimming idle in background
2. "Tap to Start" with bubble animation
3. Best score display
4. Quick tutorial option

### Gameplay States
1. **Ready** (3-second countdown)
2. **Playing** (60-90 seconds)
3. **Bonus Rush** (10 seconds, triggered by rainbow bubble)
4. **Game Over** (Score summary and rewards)

### Difficulty Progression
- **0-20 seconds**: Slow bubbles, basic patterns
- **20-40 seconds**: Medium speed, more bubbles
- **40-60 seconds**: Fast bubbles, complex patterns

- **Particles**: Small plankton floating for depth

### Fish Animation States (Rive)
1. **Idle**: Gentle fin movement, occasional blink
2. **Swimming**: Dynamic fin propulsion
3. **Turning**: Body tilt and fin adjustment
4. **Popping**: Mouth opens, eyes widen
5. **Happy**: Spin animation on combo
6. **Worried**: When near black bubble

### Bubble Animations (Rive)
1. **Rising**: Gentle wobble with size variation
2. **Pre-pop**: Slight expansion when touched
3. **Pop**: Burst into smaller bubbles
4. **Chain reaction**: Nearby bubbles wiggle

## UI/UX Design

### HUD Elements
