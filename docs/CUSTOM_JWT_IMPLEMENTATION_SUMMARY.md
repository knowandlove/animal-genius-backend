# Custom JWT Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented Phase 0, 1, and 2 of the Custom JWT Authorizer pattern for student authentication. This approach eliminates the need for Supabase user accounts for students and provides a clean, year-based authentication system.

## Completed Work

### Phase 0: Code Cleanup ✅

1. **Removed Supabase user creation for students**:
   - Updated `server/routes/room-secure.ts` to remove `signUp` calls
   - Removed password generation and email creation

2. **Deleted unnecessary functions**:
   - Removed `generateStudentEmail` from `auth-utils.ts`
   - Kept `generateSecurePassword` for potential future use

3. **Simplified authentication middleware**:
   - Updated `unified-auth.ts` to remove legacy student auth handling
   - Removed migration logic to Supabase
   - Streamlined to handle only Bearer tokens

4. **Disabled JIT provisioning**:
   - Disabled `provisionStudent` function in `jit-provisioning.ts`
   - Disabled `migrateStudentSession` function
   - Made `STUDENT_PASSWORD_SALT` optional in env config

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation ✅

1. **Created Edge Function**:
   - `supabase/functions/student-auth/index.ts` - Generates custom JWTs
   - Validates passport codes and returns 8-hour session tokens
   - Uses Supabase JWT secret for compatibility with RLS

2. **Updated authentication endpoints**:
   - Modified both `/api/room/authenticate` endpoints to call Edge Function
   - Returns JWT tokens instead of creating Supabase users

3. **Created database migration**:
   - Added `school_year` column to students table
   - Added `academic_year` to classes table
   - Created optional `passport_codes` table for future use

### Phase 2: Security (RLS Policies) ✅

1. **Created new RLS policies**:
   - Dropped old policies using `auth.uid()` for students
   - Created JWT-based policies using `auth.jwt()` claims
   - Enabled RLS on all student-related tables

2. **Policy coverage**:
   - Students table - read own, see classmates, update own
   - Student inventory - full access to own inventory
   - Currency transactions - read and create own
   - Student pets - read own, see classmates (if public)
   - Quiz submissions - read and create own

### Phase 3: Frontend Guide ✅

Created comprehensive `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` with:
- Complete component examples
- API client implementation
- Auth context and protected routes
- Inactivity timer implementation
- Migration checklist

## Architecture Benefits

1. **No fake emails** - Students don't have Supabase accounts
2. **Year-based data** - Clean slate each school year
3. **Simple passport codes** - Easy for young students
4. **8-hour sessions** - Matches school day
5. **Secure JWTs** - Compatible with Supabase RLS
6. **No password management** - Teachers handle passport codes

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Deploy Edge Function**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy student-auth --no-verify-jwt
   ```

2. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

3. **Update frontend** - Follow the Frontend Implementation Guide

### Testing Required

1. Test Edge Function with valid/invalid passport codes
2. Verify RLS policies work with JWT claims
3. Test 8-hour session expiry
4. Verify teacher auth still works normally

### Future Enhancements

1. **Passport code management UI** for teachers
2. **Bulk passport code generation**
3. **"Reveal passport" feature** for forgotten codes
4. **Legacy badge system** for returning students
5. **Year-end data archival process**

## Important Notes

- Edge Function requires `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` environment variable
- Frontend must use sessionStorage (not localStorage)
- All student data should include school_year for cleanup
- Teachers continue using standard Supabase auth

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Frontend can revert to previous version
2. Edge Function can be disabled
3. Old auth code is commented but not deleted
4. Database changes are backward compatible
