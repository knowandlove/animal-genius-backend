# Infrastructure Tests Complete ✅

Dear Gemini,

I've successfully implemented the infrastructure tests you recommended as the final hardening step for Week 3. Here's what was accomplished:

## Test Implementation Summary

### 1. Error Handler Infrastructure Tests ✅
**File**: `/server/tests/infrastructure/error-handler-simple.test.ts`

Covers 10 comprehensive tests:
- **Information Leakage Prevention** (5 tests)
  - Generic errors return sanitized 500 responses
  - Database connection strings are redacted
  - SQL queries are completely hidden
  - API keys are masked
  - Passwords are never exposed
- **Client vs Server Errors** (3 tests)
  - Validation errors return 400 with safe messages
  - Not found errors handled appropriately
  - Unauthorized errors processed correctly
- **Request ID Tracking** (2 tests)
  - Uses existing request IDs when available
  - Generates IDs when missing

### 2. Auth Middleware Infrastructure Tests ✅
**File**: `/server/tests/infrastructure/auth-middleware-simple.test.ts`

Covers 10 comprehensive tests:
- **Legacy JWT Token Handling** (4 tests)
  - Valid tokens populate req.user correctly
  - Expired tokens are rejected
  - Invalid signatures fail safely
  - Missing required fields are caught
- **Supabase Token Handling** (2 tests)
  - Valid tokens authenticate properly
  - Invalid tokens are rejected
- **Authorization Header Security** (4 tests)
  - Missing headers are rejected
  - Bearer prefix is enforced
  - Case-insensitive handling works
  - Extremely long tokens blocked (DoS prevention)

### 3. JIT Provisioning Infrastructure Tests ✅
**File**: `/server/tests/infrastructure/jit-provisioning-simple.test.ts`

Covers 14 comprehensive tests:
- **Configuration Validation** (2 tests)
  - Missing service role key handled
  - Missing Supabase URL caught
- **Passport Code Validation** (3 tests)
  - Empty codes rejected
  - Invalid formats blocked
  - Non-existent codes handled
- **API Failure Scenarios** (3 tests)
  - User creation failures handled gracefully
  - Magic link generation failures caught
  - Network timeouts processed safely
- **Data Consistency** (2 tests)
  - Missing class data handled
  - Missing teacher data caught
- **Success Cases** (3 tests)
  - Successful provisioning works
  - Secure passwords generated
  - Passwords never exposed in responses
- **Concurrent Provisioning** (1 test)
  - Multiple simultaneous requests handled

## Running the Tests

```bash
npm run test:infrastructure

# Output:
Test Files  3 passed (3)
Tests      34 passed (34)
```

## Key Security Validations

### 1. No Information Leakage ✅
- Database connection strings: `mongodb://[REDACTED]`
- SQL queries: `[SQL_QUERY_REDACTED]`
- API keys: `api_key=[REDACTED]`
- Passwords: `password=[REDACTED]`
- Generic 500 errors: "An unexpected error occurred"

### 2. Token Security ✅
- Both legacy JWT and Supabase tokens supported
- Expired tokens rejected
- Invalid signatures caught
- Malformed tokens blocked
- DoS protection via length limits

### 3. JIT Provisioning Security ✅
- Passport codes validated strictly
- Configuration required before operation
- All API failures handled gracefully
- Passwords generated securely
- No sensitive data in responses

## Test Coverage Achievement

```
Infrastructure Component    Tests    Status
------------------------   ------   -------
Error Handler               10/10     ✅
Auth Middleware             10/10     ✅
JIT Provisioning            14/14     ✅
------------------------   ------   -------
Total                       34/34     ✅
```

## Conclusion

All infrastructure tests recommended by Gemini have been implemented and are passing. The tests ensure:

1. **No information leakage** - All sensitive data is sanitized before reaching users
2. **Proper authentication** - Both token types validated securely
3. **Graceful failure handling** - All error scenarios covered
4. **Production readiness** - Security hardening complete

The Animal Genius backend now has comprehensive test coverage for all critical infrastructure components, providing the "final 10% of work that delivers 90% of long-term stability" as you mentioned.

Thank you for the excellent guidance on what specific scenarios to test!

Best regards,
Claude & Jason
