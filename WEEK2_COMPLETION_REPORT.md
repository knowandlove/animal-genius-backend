### Total Duplicate Code Removed: ~458 lines

## Task 3: Consolidate Authentication
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Phase 1 Quick Wins:
- Removed duplicate `authenticateAdmin` function (47 lines)
- Updated 8 files to use `requireAuth` + `requireAdmin` pattern
- Standardized authentication flow across all admin routes
- Improved separation of concerns

### Benefits:
- Single authentication flow for all teacher/admin routes
- Consistent error handling
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Foundation laid for future full consolidation

## Task 4: Extract Magic Numbers to Configuration
**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

### Achievements:
- Created centralized `/server/config/constants.ts`
- Extracted 100+ magic numbers across 9 files
- Organized constants into logical categories
- Implemented type-safe configuration

### Categories Organized:
- **Rate Limits**: 11 different limiters
- **Timeouts**: 7 timeout values
- **Cache**: 6 cache settings
- **Lockout**: 5 security thresholds
- **Database**: 5 pool configurations
- **Monitoring**: 3 metric settings
- **File Limits**: 4 upload constraints
- **Pagination**: 3 page settings
- **Pet System**: Game constants
- **Storage**: Bucket names and limits
- **Quiz**: Reward values
- **Session**: JWT settings

### Files Updated:
1. `rateLimiter.ts` - All rate limit values
2. `db.ts` - Database pool configuration
3. `passport-lockout.ts` - Lockout thresholds
4. `pagination.ts` - Pagination limits
5. `redis-cache.ts` - Cache TTLs and reconnection
6. `profile-cache.ts` - Profile cache TTL
7. `upload-asset.ts` - Upload limits
8. `auth-monitor.ts` - Performance thresholds

## Overall Impact

### Code Quality Improvements:
- **Total Lines Removed**: ~2,650 lines
- **Duplicate Code Eliminated**: 458 lines
- **Dead Code Removed**: 2,045 lines
- **Authentication Code Simplified**: 47 lines
- **Magic Numbers Centralized**: 100+ constants

### Maintenance Benefits:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All configuration in one place
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer files and clearer organization
3. **Type Safety**: TypeScript ensures correct usage
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear naming and comments
5. **Environment Flexibility**: Easy to override per environment

### Security Improvements:
1. **Consistent Authentication**: No more duplicate auth logic
2. **Centralized Security Settings**: All timeouts and limits in one place
3. **Better Rate Limiting**: Consistent configuration across endpoints

## Next Steps (Week 3)
With the codebase significantly cleaned up and organized, we're now ready for Week 3 tasks:
- Refactor WebSocketServer god object
- Refactor 375-line room endpoint
- Standardize error handling
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Implement monitoring and alerting

The foundation work completed in Week 2 will make these larger refactoring tasks much easier to accomplish.
