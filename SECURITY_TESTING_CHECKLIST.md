  - [ ] Test deleting class with collaborators

- [ ] **Editor Tests**:
  - [ ] Verify can view and edit class data
  - [ ] Verify can manage students
  - [ ] Verify can manage store (if permitted)
  - [ ] Verify cannot invite/remove collaborators
  - [ ] Verify cannot delete class

- [ ] **Viewer Tests**:
  - [ ] Verify read-only access to class data
  - [ ] Verify cannot modify any data
  - [ ] Verify cannot access sensitive operations
  - [ ] Test attempting write operations

### Cross-Tenant Access
- [ ] Test accessing classes not owned/shared
- [ ] Test modifying students from other classes
- [ ] Test viewing analytics from other classes
- [ ] Test currency operations on other class students

## Input Validation Tests

### UUID Validation
- [ ] Test with malformed UUIDs in path parameters
- [ ] Test with SQL injection in UUID fields
- [ ] Test with empty UUID values
- [ ] Test with special characters in UUIDs

### String Input Validation
- [ ] Test XSS payloads in:
  - [ ] Student names
  - [ ] Class names
  - [ ] Invitation messages
  - [ ] Currency transaction reasons
- [ ] Test SQL injection in all text fields
- [ ] Test with oversized inputs (>1MB strings)
- [ ] Test with null bytes in strings
- [ ] Test with Unicode/emoji abuse

### Numeric Validation
- [ ] Test currency amounts with:
  - [ ] Negative values
  - [ ] Zero values
  - [ ] Decimal values
  - [ ] String representations
  - [ ] Scientific notation
  - [ ] Values exceeding limits

## Invitation Security Tests

### Token Security
- [ ] Test invitation token randomness (collect 100+ tokens)
- [ ] Test token reuse after acceptance
- [ ] Test token reuse after revocation
- [ ] Test expired token acceptance (if implemented)
- [ ] Test token enumeration/brute force

### Invitation Flow
- [ ] Test accepting invitation for different user
- [ ] Test invitation details disclosure without auth
- [ ] Test re-inviting revoked collaborators
- [ ] Test inviting self as collaborator
- [ ] Test inviting non-existent users

## Data Exposure Tests

### API Response Filtering
- [ ] Check all endpoints for PII leakage:
  - [ ] Student passport codes
  - [ ] Email addresses
  - [ ] Personal details
  - [ ] Financial information
- [ ] Test error message information disclosure
- [ ] Test debug information in responses
- [ ] Test metadata leakage in headers

### Enumeration Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test passport code enumeration
- [ ] Test class code enumeration
- [ ] Test user ID enumeration
- [ ] Test invitation token enumeration

## Rate Limiting Tests

### Endpoint Protection
- [ ] Test rate limits on:
  - [ ] Login endpoints
  - [ ] Invitation endpoints
  - [ ] Currency operations
  - [ ] Quiz submissions
  - [ ] Store operations
- [ ] Test distributed attack simulation
- [ ] Test rate limit bypass techniques
- [ ] Test rate limit headers exposure

## Financial Transaction Tests

### Currency Operations
- [ ] Test concurrent give/take operations
- [ ] Test race conditions in balance updates
- [ ] Test transaction atomicity
- [ ] Test negative balance prevention
- [ ] Test transaction history integrity

### Store Operations
- [ ] Test purchasing without funds
- [ ] Test concurrent purchase attempts
- [ ] Test inventory duplication
- [ ] Test price manipulation attempts

## Session Management Tests

### Session Security
- [ ] Test session fixation attacks
- [ ] Test concurrent session handling
- [ ] Test session invalidation on:
  - [ ] Logout
  - [ ] Password change
  - [ ] Permission revocation
- [ ] Test session token in URLs

## Special Vulnerability Tests

### Identified Critical Issues
- [ ] Test unauthenticated room data modification
- [ ] Test student PII exposure in analytics
- [ ] Test class enumeration via public endpoint
- [ ] Test quiz submission class bypass
- [ ] Test public student profile access

### Race Conditions
- [ ] Test concurrent collaborator operations
- [ ] Test concurrent student updates
- [ ] Test concurrent inventory updates
- [ ] Test concurrent currency transactions

## Security Headers & Configuration

### Response Headers
- [ ] Check for security headers:
  - [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
  - [ ] X-Frame-Options
  - [ ] X-XSS-Protection
  - [ ] Strict-Transport-Security
  - [ ] Content-Security-Policy
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Test cookie security flags

## Logging & Monitoring Tests

### Audit Trail
- [ ] Verify logging of:
  - [ ] Authentication attempts
  - [ ] Authorization failures
  - [ ] Data modifications
  - [ ] Financial transactions
  - [ ] Security events
- [ ] Test log injection attacks
- [ ] Verify PII not logged

## Automated Security Scanning

### Tool-Based Testing

**Note**: This checklist should be executed in full before deploying the co-teacher feature to production. Each item should be tested thoroughly and documented. Any failures should be tracked as security issues and resolved according to their severity.
