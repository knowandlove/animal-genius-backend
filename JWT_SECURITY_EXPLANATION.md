# JWT Security - Why This is NOT a Vulnerability

## The "Issue" That Keeps Coming Up

Every security scan flags that our JWTs can be decoded without a secret. This is **NOT A SECURITY ISSUE**.

## Why This is By Design

### 1. JWTs are NOT Encrypted
- JWTs are **signed**, not encrypted
- They are **meant to be readable** by anyone
- The signature proves they haven't been tampered with
- This is how JWTs work everywhere (Google, Facebook, etc.)

### 2. What JWTs Contain (Safe Public Info)
```json
{
  "sub": "user-uuid",           // User ID - not secret
  "email": "teacher@school.com", // Email - not secret
  "iat": 1234567890,            // Issued at - not secret
  "exp": 1234567890             // Expiration - not secret
}
```

### 3. The ACTUAL Security

The security comes from:
1. **Supabase Signs the JWT** - Only Supabase has the secret key
2. **We Verify the Signature** - Ensures the JWT came from Supabase
3. **Can't Forge JWTs** - Without Supabase's secret, you can't create valid JWTs
4. **Can't Modify JWTs** - Any change invalidates the signature

### 4. What Would Be a REAL Security Issue

ACTUAL problems would be:
- ❌ Storing passwords in JWTs (we don't)
- ❌ Storing API keys in JWTs (we don't)  
- ❌ Not verifying JWT signatures (we do verify)
- ❌ Accepting expired JWTs (we check expiration)

### 5. Our Implementation is Correct

```typescript
// This is CORRECT - we verify with Supabase
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser(token);

// The JWT being "decodable" is EXPECTED
// Supabase validates the signature for us
```

## For Scanners/Auditors

When you see "JWT can be decoded without secret":
1. ✅ This is expected behavior
2. ✅ JWTs are designed to be readable
3. ✅ Security comes from signature verification
4. ✅ Supabase handles the cryptographic verification

## TL;DR

**JWTs being decodable is not a bug, it's a feature.** The security is in the signature, not in hiding the contents.
