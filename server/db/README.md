# Database Optimization

## Indexes Added

This migration adds performance indexes to frequently queried fields:

### Users Table
- `email` - For login queries
- `is_admin` - For admin panel filtering

### Classes Table  
- `teacher_id` - For fetching teacher's classes
- `code` - For student class joining
- `created_at` - For sorting classes by date

### Quiz Submissions Table
- `class_id` - For fetching class submissions
- `completed_at` - For recent submissions
- `animal_type` - For animal distribution queries
- `animal_genius` - For genius type analytics
- Composite: `(class_id, completed_at)` - For efficient analytics

### Lesson Progress Table
- `teacher_id` - For teacher progress tracking
- `class_id` - For class progress views
- `completed_at` - For recent activity
- Composite: `(class_id, lesson_id)` - For progress checks

### Admin Logs Table
- `admin_id` - For admin activity tracking
- `timestamp` - For chronological queries
- `action` - For filtering by action type

## Running the Migration

### In Development (Local/Replit)
```bash
npm run db:add-indexes
```

### In Production (Render)
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Open the Shell tab for your service
3. Run: `npm run db:add-indexes`

## Performance Impact

These indexes will significantly improve:
- Login/authentication speed
- Dashboard loading times
- Class analytics queries
- Student report generation
- Admin panel responsiveness

The initial migration may take a few seconds on large databases, but subsequent queries will be much faster.
