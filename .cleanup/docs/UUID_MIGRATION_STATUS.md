# UUID Migration Status

## Database Changes âœ…
- All `teacher_id` columns have been migrated from `integer` to `uuid`
- Foreign key constraints updated to reference `profiles.id` instead of `users.id`
- Migration completed successfully

## Code Changes Applied âœ…

### 1. Schema Updates (shared/schema.ts)
- Updated `classes.teacherId` to use `text` type with UUID reference
- Updated `lessonProgress.teacherId` to use `text` type with UUID reference  
- Updated `adminLogs.adminId` and `targetUserId` to use `text` type with UUID reference
- Updated `currencyTransactions.teacherId` to use `text` type with UUID reference
- Updated `purchaseRequests.processedBy` to use `text` type with UUID reference
- Added `profilesRelations` and updated all relations to use `profiles` instead of `users`

### 2. Auth Middleware Updates (server/middleware/auth.ts)
- Updated Express Request interface to use UUID string for userId
- Modified all auth middleware to handle UUIDs from Supabase
- Added profile data to request object

### 3. Routes Updates (server/routes.ts)
- Removed old JWT-based registration/login endpoints
- Removed dependency on JWT library
- Added UUID-compatible storage wrapper for class operations
- Added console logging for debugging

### 4. Storage Compatibility (server/storage-uuid-fixes.ts)
- Created UUID-compatible versions of storage methods
- Direct Supabase queries that handle UUID teacher_id properly

## Next Steps

1. **Test the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd animal-genius-backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Update remaining storage methods** that need UUID support:
   - `getClassById` - needs to handle UUID teacher_id check
   - Admin methods that reference teacher/user IDs
   - Any other methods that join with teacher_id

3. **Frontend updates** will be needed to:
   - Handle UUID user IDs instead of integers
   - Update any localStorage/sessionStorage of user IDs

## Current State
- Database: Migrated to UUIDs âœ…
- Code: Partially updated to handle UUIDs ðŸŸ¡
- Backend should be able to start and handle basic auth/class operations
